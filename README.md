# LeanixMetricsSaver  
Program to query factsheets from LeanIX, filter out the complete ones, and post information on the number of incomplete factsheets to LeanIX metrics. Please be sure to only use Java 8 (1.8) when running the program as LeanIX's Java SDK doesn't work with the latest version of Java as of writing this.  
## How To Use  
To use the program, you will need your Workspace ID and an API Token. Both can be found in the API Tokens section on the Administrator Page. You will need to set these equal to the corresponding variables at the beginning of the main function in LeanixMetrics.java. Once that's done, everything should be taken care of and you can run LeanixMetrics.java to run the program.
